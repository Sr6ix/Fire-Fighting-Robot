# Fire-Fighting-Robot
A personal arduino project which had a simple goal of being able to navigate a randomized physical maze and identify fire which is then blown out by a mechanized fan.
Uses two servos as driving motors for the wheels, an ultrasonic sensor in order to calculate the distance between the robot and walls so that the bot does not run into anything and is able to reach the end of the maze.
A flame sensor is also used to find the flame which would have been located near the end of the maze.
All of these parts are mounted on a 3-D printed mould.
